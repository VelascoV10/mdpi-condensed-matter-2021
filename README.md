Code repository for the article "Dynamic structure associated to polaronic tunneling in cuprate superconductors as a quantum Kuramoto synchronization problem", submited to Condensed Matter in September 2021.

Here you'll find the exact diagonalization code we've used to diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix that describes our system. The main code has 3 modules: bits.py, hoppings.py and hamiltonian.py. 

bits.py: here the functions will define the basis states we'll use to construct our Hamiltionian matrix. In the
